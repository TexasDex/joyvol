# joyvol

Joyvol is a stupidly simple python script that allows you to automatically mute and unmute channel when a joystick button is pressed.  I use this along with a rig that I hang my headphones on, so whenever I pick up the headphones my speakers (which are connected to the 'surround' ALSA channel, automatically mute, and when I put the headphones back the speakers unmute.
